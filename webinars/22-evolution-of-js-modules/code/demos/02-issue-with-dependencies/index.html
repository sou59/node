        <!--
            Scripts need to be included in order. For example, Bootstrap requires jQuery and hence the jQuery script has to be included before Bootstrap.
            Here we have bar.js depending on foo.js. Hence foo.js must be included before bar.js.
            In a large project maintaining correct order of a huge number of dependencies is very difficult and prone to errors.
