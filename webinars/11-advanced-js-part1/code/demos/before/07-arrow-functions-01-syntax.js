// Step 1.1: Define a function sum that calculates sum of 2 arguments passed to it and returns it

// in fact is there is only one statement in function body that returns a value, we can use a shorthand syntax like so
// Step 1.2: Define sum without braces for the function body (this is possible only if there is a single statement)

// if there is a single argument, even the brackets are not required
// Step 1.3: Define a pow2 functions without braces for function body and parentheses for argument - the function calculates 2 raised to passed exponent and returns the result


// if the return value is immaterial and there is just one statememt, you will often find this kind of uage (the return value of console.log() is not important)
// Step 2: Define a greet function that takes in name and greeting and logs the greeting message for the person with given name. Do not use the return keyword (essentially returning the return value of console.log() which is anyway inconsequential)
